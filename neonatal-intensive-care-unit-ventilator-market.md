<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) ventilator market comprises two primary types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators require intubation, providing direct airway support for critically ill neonates, facilitating accurate control over ventilation parameters. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, deliver respiratory support without intubation, using interfaces like nasal masks or prongs. This method reduces the risk of complications associated with invasive procedures, promoting patient comfort and minimizing trauma, thus catering to diverse clinical needs in neonatal care.</p></p>
