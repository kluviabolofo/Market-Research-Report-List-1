<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Lung Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Venovenous (VV) Artificial Lung Devices</li><li>Venoarterial (VA) Artificial Lung Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial lung devices market is primarily segmented into venovenous (VV) and venoarterial (VA) devices. VV artificial lung devices are designed to oxygenate blood by circulating it from the veins and back, often used for patients with severe respiratory failure. In contrast, VA artificial lung devices provide both oxygenation and cardiac support, drawing blood from the venous system and returning it to the arterial system, making them suitable for patients with both respiratory and cardiac failure. Each type addresses critical health needs effectively.</p></p>
