<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hypo-sensitization Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Subcutaneous Immunotherapy</li><li>Sublingual Immunotherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hypo-sensitization therapies primarily include subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT). SCIT involves administering allergen extracts via injections to gradually desensitize the immune system, often requiring regular visits to a healthcare provider. SLIT, on the other hand, delivers allergen extracts under the tongue, offering a more convenient, self-administered alternative with potentially fewer side effects. Both methods aim to reduce allergy symptoms by promoting tolerance to specific allergens, enhancing patients' quality of life.</p></p>
